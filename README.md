## Problem

There seems to be a lot of fathers with unused or in really good conditions baby or toddler clothing as it
really is of little use during child's growth.

- Fathers end up with new, quality baby or children clothing just to build up some dust or to end up on the trash can.
- Following the previous statement, some fathers look for ways to borrow child clothing from relatives or friends
- Some fathers might look for a second hand clothing focused marketplace

_At least in my country (Mexico), it doesn't seem to be a really focus website on letting people pass on their children's clothing
for a profit_

## Solution overview

- Let users register with their email
- Let users login with a magic link
- Users can be buyers and sellers
- Let sellers post their toddler's or baby's clothing
- If a potential buyer takes interest in a product, process it through a smart contract
- Pay with eth
- Settle the contract and execute it upon product arrival on buyers side
- Group and find most beloved brands
- Make it really simple, really focused, so it's easy to sell and buy
